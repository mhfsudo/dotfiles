### Create Alias for PowerShell
To run it from everywhere, I recommend a Alias in the PowerShell profile.
1. Edit or create the following file with the text editor of your choice. You could check the Path with $PROFILE: ```C:\Users\<URE USERNAME>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Mircosoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1```
2. Add the following Line: 
    ```Set-Alias update_powershell C:\<PATH TO THE SCRIPT\update.ps1```
3. Now you could runt the File with the set Alias. In this example: 
    ```update_script```
